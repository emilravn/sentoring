The easiest way is to setup your own virtual environment and rebuilding from the `requirements.txt` file. These setup instructions are for Linux.

1. Make sure you have Python3 installed.
2. Clone the repository and CD into it.
3. Create a new virtual environent, ie. `python3 -m venv .env`
4. Activate that new virtual environment, ie. `source .env/bin/activate/`
5. Rebuild packages as listed in `requirements.txt` by doing `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
