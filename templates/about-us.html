        <p>Sentoring is a tool that will retrieve and analyze statements said by individuals on Twitter. These
            statements
            will then be fed into a sentimental model for further analysis, recognizing positive, negative, and neutral
            emotions in online text data. Ultimately, it will tell and show you through statistical models whether what
            you searched for is in good standing with the general public. <br><br> By analyzing the sentiment in social
            media comments, businesses can better understand how customers feel
            about
            their brands and prouducts. <br><br> This tool was made by three BSc. students in Information Technology at
            Aalborg University in 2021.
